🔷 What Is Bluetooth in Android?

Bluetooth in Android refers to the system-level support for short-range wireless communication between devices. It allows Android apps to communicate with other Bluetooth-enabled devices like:
- Wireless headphones or speakers. 
- Smartwatches and fitness trackers
- IoT devices (like robot vacuums, smart tools, etc.)
- Medical sensors 
- Home automation gear (like locks, thermostats)

🧭 Types of Bluetooth in Android
There are two main types:
1. Classic Bluetooth.
   * Used for continuous, high-throughput connections (like audio streaming). 
   * Suitable for devices like headphones or car stereos.
   
2. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
   * Designed for low-power, short-burst communication. 
   * Used for smart devices, sensors, wearables, etc. 
   * Preferred for apps that talk to tools, health devices, or anything battery-powered.
